> Normal cooking time of brown rice is around 35-40 minutes (at least so it says on the package) - in this recipe
 I split the time in the following manner: 10 minutes in normal pot (pressure cooker without the pot)
 and the the rest 25-30 minutes is cooked in the pressured cooker (it should take at least half of the "normal" cooking time)

## Tips
1. Buy a pressure cooker - it will save usually half of the cooking time
2. You can clean and chop the mushrooms while the rice is cooking in the open pressure cooker (this is the task I "love" the most in this recipe)
3. It is really easy to wash the rice in a bigger strainer and a pot

## Did you know?
1. The complete milling and polishing that converts brown rice into white rice destroys 67% of the vitamin B3, 80% of the vitamin B1, 90% of the vitamin B6, half of the manganese, half of the phosphorus, 60% of the iron, and all of the dietary fiber and essential fatty acids. So stick to the whole grain - [more facts about brown rice](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=128)
2. Fresh mushrooms can be added to everyday dishes to provide an extra serving of vegetables and deliver important nutrients including niacin, selenium, and riboflavin - [more nutritional facts and benefits of mushrooms](http://m.mushroominfo.com/benefits/)
